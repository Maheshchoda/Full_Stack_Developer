-> In order to secure the transmission of information, SSH employs a number
   of different types of data manipulation techniques at various points in the transaction.
-> These includes forms of Symmetrical encryption, Asymmetrical encryption, and Hashing.

Symmetrical encryption:-
      -> It uses a secret key for both encryption and decryption.

  ->  Actually we don't pass that key to another user. Here we use key exchange algorithm.

Asymmetrical encryption:-
      -> It uses two key's private key and public key.
      -> The public key can be freely shared with any party.
      -> Public key is used for encryption and private key is used for decryption.

Hashing:-
  ->  Another form of data manipulation that SSH takes advantage of is cryptographic hashing.
      Cryptographic hash functions are methods of creating a succinct "signature" or summary of a set of
      information.
  ->  This is done with the help of HMAC(Hash based Message Authentication Code).
