Pictures taken by digital cameras can contain a lot of information, like data,
time and camera used. But last generation cameras and phones can add the GPS coordinates
of the place where it was taken, making it a privacy hazard. You can be showing your
home's location to the world.

So we need to use some kind of tool, to remove the information

Ex:- https://www.verexif.com/en/

Display different sized images for different backgrounds.

 -> In order to do that we can use media query's.

Ex:-
   @media screen and(min-width: 900px){
    body{
      background: url('./new.jpg') no-repeat center center fixed;
    }
   }

   @media screen and(max-width: 500px){
    body{
      background: url('./new1.jpg') no-repeat center center fixed;
    }
   }
